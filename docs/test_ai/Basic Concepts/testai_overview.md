### What is Test.AI
**Test.AI** is a software that uses **language models (LLMs)** and artificial intelligence agents to efficiently generate automated test files. It operates in two main stages: **Gherkin File Generatio**n and Step Generation in **C# using xUnit**, based on requirement documents in the **.andes** format, as well as the generation of **IEEE-standard test plans.**

### Key benefits:
- Reduces test writing time.
- Generates consistent and readable test code.
- Produces IEEE-standard test plans.
- Integrates with VS Code and CLI for different usage scenarios.

### How to use in Visual Studio Code:
1. Install the extension from the VS Code extensions tab.
2. Use a **.andes** file or a Gherkin **.feature** file.
3. To use the **feateures**, follow the steps in [Getting Started](./testai_guide.md).
