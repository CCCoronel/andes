## [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com) + [Python](https://www.python.org)

### What is CrewAI

Crew AI is an open-source Python framework designed to create and orchestrate teams of AI agents, called “crews.” The concept is simple but powerful: instead of relying on a single generalist agent, you build a structured team where each agent has a clearly defined role—researcher, writer, analyst, strategist—and they collaborate to execute complex workflows with higher precision and less error.

### What is Python

Python is a high-level programming language known for being simple, readable, and versatile. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, automation, and many other areas.
