### What is Test.AI
Test.AI is a software that uses language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence agents to efficiently generate automated test files. It operates in two main stages: Gherkin File Generation and Step Generation in C# using xUnit, based on requirement documents in the .andes format, as well as the generation of IEEE-standard test plans.

### Key benefits:
- Reduces test writing time.
- Generates consistent and readable test code.
- Produces IEEE-standard test plans.
- Integrates with VS Code and CLI for different usage scenarios.

### How to use:
1. Install the extension from the VS Code extensions tab.
2. Use a .andes file or a Gherkin .feature file.
3. Follow the steps in [Getting Started](./testai.md).
