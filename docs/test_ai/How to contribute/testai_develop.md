## Test.AI repository

If you’d like to help improve this project, there are two main ways you can contribute: reporting issues and submitting pull requests. Don’t worry if you’re new to GitHub, the steps are simple!

## Repository

All contributions happen in our **GitHub repository**: [Repository](https://github.com/eduardo-pitanga/leds-tools-testai)

### Reporting Issues (problems, bugs, or suggestions)

 1. Create a **GitHub account** (if you don’t have one yet): https://github.com/join

 2. Go to the repository’s **Issues tab**: Issues Page

 3. Click on **“New Issue”**.

    - Example: ```New Issue → Describe the problem → Submit```

 4. Add a **clear title and detailed description** (screenshots help a lot!).

## Submitting Pull Requests (code changes)

1. Fork the repository: click the **“Fork”** button at the top-right of the repo page.

2. Clone your fork to your computer. Example:

```
git clone https://github.com/eduardo-pitanga/leds-tools-testai
```

4. Commit and push your changes to your fork.

5. Open a **Pull Request**:

    - Go to your forked repo on GitHub.

    - Click **“New Pull Request”**.

    - Select your branch and submit.

### Guidelines for Pull Requests

- Your code must be **clean, clear, and easy to read.**

- Add comments when necessary to explain tricky parts.

- Always follow **best practices** (naming conventions, indentation, reusable components, etc.).

- Avoid adding unnecessary files or unrelated changes.

- Test your code before submitting the PR.

## Notes

- No contribution is too small — even fixing typos helps!

- If you get stuck, check GitHub’s beginner guides: [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started).

- All contributions are reviewed before being merged.
