# Suggestions for Improvements

## Quality & Reliability
- Add more **unit** and **integration** tests.
- Increase **test coverage** and track it with **reports** (per file/module).
- Standardize **logging** and **error messages** (clear, actionable, with codes/context).

## Configuration & Maintenance
- **Modularize** the code to ease maintenance and testing.
- **Document** the architecture and main flow.

## **New Features**
**1. .andes File Import**
- Upload and automatic reading of .andes files.
- Structured parsing to extract requirements, constraints, and functional descriptions.

**2. Automatic Test Case Generation**
- Based on the .andes, the functionality should generate an IEEE standard Test Plan.

**3. IEEE Compliance Validation**
- The generated plan goes through an automatic check to ensure that all mandatory IEEE sections are present.

**4. Test Cases**
- Automated tests to ensure the correct functioning of the tool.
