# Project Management

This section is dedicated to the management of the CodeWise project itself. It contains documents related to project planning, communication, and decision-making.

As the project evolves under the new development team, we will add more artifacts here, such as:

-   **Roadmap:** The long-term vision for the project.
-   **Release Plan:** The plan for upcoming releases.
-   **Communication Plan:** How the team communicates and stays in sync.
-   **Meeting Notes:** Notes from team meetings.
