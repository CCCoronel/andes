# Project Vision and Goals

This document outlines the fundamental vision and objectives for the CodeWise project.

## Project Vision

To optimize the code review process in software projects, transforming a manual and time-consuming task into an automated, intelligent, and sustainable part of the development cycle.

## Problem Statement

Development teams spend a significant amount of time on manual code reviews, which can be subjective and lead to inconsistencies in code quality. Furthermore, the documentation of changes in Pull Requests is often rushed, creating a knowledge gap in the project's history.

## Key Goals

The central proposal of CodeWise is to address these challenges by focusing on three main goals:

1.  **Reduce Manual Effort:** Significantly decrease the time reviewers spend on routine checks and documentation.
2.  **Standardize Code Architecture:** Enforce quality standards and principles like S.O.L.I.D. automatically and consistently across the team.
3.  **Improve Development Efficiency:** Make the overall development process more efficient by providing faster feedback and clearer, standardized documentation.

## Core Solution

The tool will be delivered as a library installable via `pip`, featuring integration hooks to act directly within repositories. It will leverage generative language models to automatically analyze Pull Requests, identify architectural improvements, suggest design patterns, and generate PR titles and descriptions.
