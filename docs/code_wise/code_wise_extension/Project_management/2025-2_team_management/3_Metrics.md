# Analysis Metrics for Software Teams

## 1. Cycle Time
A simple metric focused on workflow efficiency.

```math
\text{Cycle Time} = t_{end} - t_{start}

```
### Objective/Result
**y = Elapsed time** from when active work begins on a task until its completion.

### Parameters
* **t_start**: The moment a task enters the "In Progress" status.
* **t_end**: The moment a task enters the "Done" status.

### Analysis and Insights
**Cycle Time** is a fundamental metric for identifying bottlenecks in the process. A long or inconsistent cycle time may indicate issues such as:
* External blockers (dependencies).
* Unclear requirements.
* Delays in code review.
* An unstable testing environment.

Analyzing this metric helps optimize the delivery flow and make forecasts more realistic.

## 2. Throughput
A simple metric focused on delivery capacity.

````math
\text{Throughput} = \frac{\sum n_{items}}{\text{Period}}
````
### Objective/Result
**y = The number of work items** (tasks, stories, bugs) completed within a time period.

### Parameters
* **n_items**: The number of tasks moved to "Done".
* **Period**: A defined time interval (e.g., 1 week, a 15-day sprint).

### Analysis and Insights
**Throughput** measures the team's actual delivery capacity without relying on subjective estimates like story points. It is excellent for:
* Analyzing productivity trends.
* Forecasting the team's future capacity based on historical data.
* Understanding the impact of changes to the team or process.

## 3. Change Failure Rate
A more complex metric focused on quality and stability.

```math
\text{Failure Rate \%} = \left( \frac{\text{Failed Deployments}}{\text{Total Deployments}}\right) \times 100

```

### Objective/Result

y = The percentage of deployments to production that result in a failure, requiring corrective action (such as a hotfix or rollback).

### Parameters

**Total Deployments:** A count of all deployments to the production environment in a given period. This data is typically sourced from a CI/CD system (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).

**Failed Deployments:** A count of deployments that are considered failures. A deployment is marked as a failure if it directly leads to one of the following outcomes:

* A rollback is performed.

* A hotfix or emergency patch is required.

* Service degradation occurs (e.g., increased error rates, high latency) that breaches an SLO.

* A critical incident (P0/P1) is triggered.

* Note: Accurately identifying a failed deployment often requires correlating data from CI/CD, monitoring, and incident management tools, which is why this metric is considered more complex to implement.

### Analysis and Insights

This is one of the four key DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics and serves as a strong indicator of the engineering process's quality and stability.

**Balancing Speed vs. Stability:** It should be analyzed alongside Deployment Frequency. The goal is to deliver value quickly and reliably. A high deployment frequency is only valuable if the change failure rate remains low.

**Industry Benchmarks (DORA Report):** Use these tiers to gauge performance:

* Elite: 0-15%

* High: 16-20%

* Medium: 21-30%

* Low: 31-45%

**Driving Improvements:** A high rate signals a need to invest in technical practices such as:

* Improving automated test coverage and reliability.

* Strengthening code review (Peer Review) processes.

* Implementing safer deployment strategies (e.g., Canary Releases, Blue-Green Deployment).
