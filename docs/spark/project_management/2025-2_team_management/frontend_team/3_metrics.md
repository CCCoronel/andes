# The Log-Linear Learning Curve
```math
y = ax^{-b}
```

## Objective/Result
y = Accumulated average cost (in work hours) per unit produced.  

## Parameters
x = Accumulated number of units produced.  

a = Cost (in work hours) to produce the first unit.  

b = Learning rate (or elasticity).

### Parameters Determination
x = Number of concluded issue deliveries.

a = Time spent for the first issue delivery.

b = Estimated value, derived from the expected cost per delivery.
