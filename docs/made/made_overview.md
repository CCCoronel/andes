# What is MADE

![MADE Logo](./img/made_logo.png)

**Welcome to MADE!** If you're new to project management automation or looking for a simple way to organize your team's work, you're in the right place.

MADE (Management As Code) is a friendly tool that helps you describe your projects using simple text files, then automatically creates beautiful documentation and GitHub issues from those descriptions. Think of it as "writing a recipe for your project" that a computer can follow to set everything up for you.

## What problems does MADE solve?

**Before MADE:** You spend hours manually creating GitHub issues, updating project boards, writing status reports, and keeping documentation in sync.

**With MADE:** You write one simple `.made` file describing your project, and MADE automatically generates:
- 📋 Organized documentation (with charts and timelines)
- 🎯 GitHub issues and project boards
- 📊 Progress reports and metrics
- 🗺️ Project roadmaps

## What you'll create with MADE

MADE helps you work with familiar project concepts, but in a structured way:

- **Project**: Basic info about your work (name, timeline, goals)
- **Team**: Who's working on what
- **Backlog**: Your to-do list organized as Epics → Stories → Tasks
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed work periods with specific goals
- **Roadmap**: High-level milestones and releases

*Don't worry if some terms are new — we'll explain everything step by step!*

## Your first 5 minutes with MADE

Here's what a typical MADE workflow looks like:

1. **Write** a simple `.made` file describing your project (like filling out a form)
2. **Run** one command to process the file
3. **Get** automatic documentation and optionally sync with GitHub
4. **Update** your `.made` file as the project evolves

**Example**: Instead of manually creating 20 GitHub issues, you describe them once in your `.made` file, and MADE creates them all at once — with proper labels, assignments, and organization.

## Why teams love MADE

✅ **Saves time**: Automate repetitive project setup tasks  
✅ **Stays in sync**: One file keeps everything updated  
✅ **Team-friendly**: Easy to review changes like code  
✅ **Flexible**: Works for small teams or large projects  
✅ **Familiar**: Uses tools you already know (VS Code, GitHub, Markdown)
