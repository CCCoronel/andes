## 1. Avoid Duplication Of Issues On github

When reading a .made file in the extension to generate the issues, make comparisons with the existing repository and ignore the issues that have already been created.

## 2. Allow use of github templates

Allow the user to define the templates that will be used in each issue type. 

This template should be placed by the user on a folder, in the same directory as the .made and .env files.


## 3. The program should be reworked to use event-based programming paradigm

Change the MADE source code so that it works with event-based and no longer with condition-checking.
